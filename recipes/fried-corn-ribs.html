<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    These air fried corn ribs are reminiscent of Mexican street corn, but each ear is split into quarters and then air fried. I used frozen corn on the cob which I thawed. 
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    This recipe requires corn, cooking spray, cheese, Mexican crema, fresca, and 
minced fresh cilantro
</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 ears ears corn on the cob </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons "Everything but the Elote seasoning" (Trader Joe's®), divided </li>
    <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated cotija cheese </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema, crema fresca</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, or more to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used a wüsthof nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves flat on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn)</li>
    <li>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seasoning over the 16 corn ribs.</li>
    <li>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.</li>
    <li>    Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and remaining seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
</ol>
