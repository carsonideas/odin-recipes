<h2>Description</h2>
<p> This version of Sloppy Joes ups the nutrition ante by swapping the meat for lentils, and adding in extra veggies. Adjust this recipe to how you prefer your Sloppy Joes--make them sweeter with additional molasses, spicier with additional chili powder, or tangier with additional mustard. Serve warm, with your favorite rolls or buns, and top with sliced red onion and fresh spinach or lettuce, if desired</p>
